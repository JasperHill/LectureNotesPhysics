Dear Amy


thanks again for your nice lectures in Trento, and for 
accepting our invitation to write them up for a
volume to be submitted to Lecture Notes in Physics by Springer. 
We are very happy to inform you that Springer has
accepted our proposal. 

Please see at the end for the plan of the volume.
You are encouraged to coordinate material with each other, 
whenever you feel it useful, and 
please note that you are most welcome to
invite co-authors - including junior ones. 
As this is meant as a course the reccomendation is
to include exercises and links to software if appropriate. 

The proposed deadline is *March31st*, and Springer macros
are attached.

We are very happy with the success of this proposal and we
are eagerly looking forward to your contributions! Please
do not hesitate and get back to us with any remaining question.


ThankYou

With all the best wishes

Morten, Mpaola and Bira
