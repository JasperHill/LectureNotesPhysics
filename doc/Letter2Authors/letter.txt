Dear all

first of all thanks so much for being interested in contributing to
a proposed volume in Lecture Notes of Physics. And to those of you who taught in Trento,
thanks again for your nice lectures in Trento, and for 
accepting our invitation to write them up for a
volume to be submitted to Lecture Notes in Physics by Springer. 
We have also invited Hans-Werner Hammer and Dean Lee to add two chapters on effective field theory and nuclei on the lattice.  We believe that the various chapters will give a
nice overview of ongoing research in theoretical nuclear physics aiming at a first principle perspective.

We are very happy to inform you that Springer has
accepted our proposal. 

Please see at the end of this letter a possible  plan of the volume.
We attach also a first layout of the document as a pdf file.
You are encouraged to coordinate material with each other, 
whenever you feel it useful, and 
please note that you are most welcome to
invite co-authors - including junior ones. 
As this is meant as a course the recommendation is
to include exercises and links to software if appropriate. 



The proposed deadline is *March31st*, and Springer macros and all chapters are 
available at the github address https://github.com/ManyBodyPhysics/LectureNotesPhysics
as latex files. 

The material can easily be downloaded from the github address, 
The various chapters with ditto suggested authors are listed below. The main file
is called lnp.tex. It suffices that you edit your own contribution.
If you have a github account, we can add you as a contributor. If not, feel free to edit the relevant chapter and just send us the final version when you are ready.

We are very happy with the success of this proposal and we
are eagerly looking forward to your contributions! Please
do not hesitate and get back to us with any remaining question.


ThankYou

With all the best wishes

Bira, Maria Paola and Morten
