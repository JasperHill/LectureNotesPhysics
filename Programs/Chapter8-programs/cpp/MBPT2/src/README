Makefile should not need many modifications to work.
Just set up pointer to CBLAS I think.

Minimal example run:

./main.exe 1 0.08 1 3 14 

should get MBPT2corr/A = -0.175650285

The input parameters mean:
1 = calculate infinite matter with minnesota potential
0.08 = density of infinite matter
1 = neutrons only (2 for neutrons and protons)
3 = number of single particle momentum shells
14 = number of neutrons in calculation (must be magic numbers)
